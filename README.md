# Draugr Time

**Local activity tracking with a native Rust desktop app.**

Draugr Time records your active application, window title and active/away time,
then shows them on a daily timeline. It is a free, GPL-3.0 project inspired by
ManicTime's workflow. Your history stays on your computer.

> **Early development:** Day/Overview/Week, tags, rules, monthly reports,
> CSV/JSON and ActivityWatch import work. Release 1.0 is next.

## What works

- Native **Iced** UI with light, dark and system themes.
- Active-window and idle tracking on Windows, macOS and Linux X11.
- Wayland backends for GNOME, KDE, Sway and Hyprland. GNOME/KDE need a local
  compositor bridge; see [Wayland setup](docs/wayland.md).
- Day timeline with computer, application, document and tag tracks; zoom, pan,
  range selection, duration summaries, hierarchical tags and away-time tagging.
- Background recording, tray controls, pause/resume and optional startup at login.
- Day overview, weekly timelines, monthly reports and timesheets; CSV/JSON export,
  ActivityWatch import and a separate headless `draugr-time-cli`.
- Local SQLite storage and a selectable data folder.

One executable contains the UI, tracking, storage and localhost API. There is
no web frontend or separate service to launch. Normal launches have no demo mode.

## Screenshots

These screenshots show generated sample history, not personal activity.

## Build and run

Install stable Rust. Linux needs librsvg and libxkbcommon-x11 development packages,
a StatusNotifierItem tray host and xdg-desktop-portal with a desktop backend. Windows needs MSVC; macOS needs Xcode
command-line tools. Installers are not available yet.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hlophlopgaming/DraugrTime.git
cd DraugrTime
cargo run --release --package draugr-time
```

The executable is `target/release/draugr-time` (`.exe` on Windows). Press
**Start recording** to collect activity. Closing the window keeps recording
in the tray; **Quit** stops the application.

See [development instructions](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for checks and diagnostics,
and [desktop usage](docs/desktop.md) for settings and platform notes.

## Data and privacy

- History is stored locally in SQLite. No account, cloud uploads or telemetry.
- Application network traffic stays on localhost; compositor IPC stays local.
- New installations use the OS local-data folder under `DraugrTime`. Existing
  installations can continue using their legacy `DagdaTime` folder.
- Settings → Data folder selects another folder for the next launch; existing
  history remains in its current location.

## Roadmap

- [x] **M0–M3.5:** workspace, storage, native watchers, local API and desktop shell.
- [x] **M4:** Day timeline, range selection and summaries.
- [x] **M5:** tag editing, tag manager and away-time tagging.
- [x] **M5.5:** GTK-free Linux tray, day-data cleanup and lower desktop memory usage.
- [x] **M6:** automatic tagging rules with preview/history undo; eight interface languages, OS detection, saved selection and English fallback. Platform/translation review: [M6 verification](docs/m6.md).
- [x] **M7:** Week view, reports, CSV/JSON export and ActivityWatch import.
- [x] ~~**M9:** browser extension~~ — dropped: window titles already cover browser pages.
- [ ] **M10 — 1.0:** app icon everywhere, built-in CLI on Linux/macOS, first-run onboarding, minimal privacy settings.
- [ ] **M11 — 1.1:** installers: Windows installer, AppImage, Flatpak, macOS DMG.
- [ ] **M12:** design, backups, title masking, notes, shortcuts, file paths, Git branch detection.

## License

[GNU GPLv3](LICENSE). Draugr Time is independent of ManicTime and ActivityWatch.

M6 adds regex auto-tagging with priority, live preview and reversible history application.
Settings offers English, Russian, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese
